# A pretty minimalist theme for XMonad and taffybar!

Includes icons from font awesome, and adi1090x's (amazing rofi menus)[https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi]
Colours were picked to match (this wallpaper)[https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kw/wallhaven-kwd36d.jpg] unfortunatly it seems the original artist's page has gone down, so I'm not sure who made it.
