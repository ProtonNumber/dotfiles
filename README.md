# A blue minimalist theme for XMonad and taffybar!

Includes icons from font awesome, and adi1090x's [amazing rofi menus](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi). 

Colours were picked to match [this wallpaper](https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/kw/wallhaven-kwd36d.jpg) unfortunately it seems the original artist's page has gone down, so I'm not sure who made it. 

A couple of things to note:
 * Pywal is used to load the colourschemes, without it the terminal will use its defaults.
 * XMonad is configured to launch Alacritty. Make sure to set this to the terminal of your choice.
 * I use a [slightly modified](https://github.com/ProtonNumber/taffybar/tree/cpuMonitor) version of taffybar. It just formats the CPU usage differently.
  
Nothing here has any complex dependencies; it should be pretty much plug and play. Hopefully.
